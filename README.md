# Psychic-Game

About Homework:
Had to create a game where you guessed the right letter against a computer. If you matched the computers guess then you won, if not then you lost.

Styling Inspiration: 
I decided to style it a bit like what you would see if you ever went to a fortune teller. I have only been to one in my life and she had lots of pictures of eyes and fortune balls. The font styles were also very 80s esque.
